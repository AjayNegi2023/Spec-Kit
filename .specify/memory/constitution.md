# Alumni Connect Portal Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Minimalist Architecture
The application MUST follow a minimalist architecture approach focusing only on core MVP features. All features MUST be implemented using React + TypeScript with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and json-server backend. No external authentication providers or complex features are allowed. Each component MUST serve a single, clear purpose.

### II. Type Safety
All code MUST be written in TypeScript with strict type checking enabled. Interface definitions MUST be shared between frontend and backend. API endpoints MUST be defined using OpenAPI-style documentation. No implicit any types are allowed.

### III. Simulated Authentication
Authentication MUST be implemented using json-server's built-in features for local development. No third-party authentication providers are allowed. User sessions MUST be simulated using local storage. All authentication-related code MUST be isolated to enable easy replacement in future versions.

### IV. User-First Design
All features MUST prioritize user experience for alumni and students. The interface MUST be intuitive and responsive. Required features are: user profile management and alumni directory browsing. Complex features like messaging or file uploads are explicitly prohibited to maintain simplicity.

### V. Iterative Development
Development MUST follow an iterative approach starting with minimal viable features. Each feature MUST be completely functional before moving to the next. Breaking changes MUST be avoided during the MVP phase. All code MUST be written to enable future expansions without major refactoring.

## Technical Constraints

1. Frontend:
   - MUST use React with TypeScript and Vite
   - MUST use Tailwind CSS for styling
   - MUST maintain responsive design for all screens
   - MUST NOT use external authentication providers
   - MUST NOT implement file upload features

2. Backend:
   - MUST use json-server for API simulation
   - MUST define clear OpenAPI-style endpoint documentation
   - MUST maintain a simple db.json structure
   - MUST NOT implement real authentication
   - MUST NOT use external databases

## Development Workflow

1. Feature Implementation:
   - Create TypeScript interfaces first
   - Implement API endpoints in json-server
   - Develop React components
   - Add Tailwind styling
   - Test functionality
   
2. Code Organization:
   - Maintain clear component hierarchy
   - Keep related files close together
   - Document all API endpoints
   - Include setup instructions in README

## Governance

This constitution serves as the fundamental guide for the Alumni Connect Portal MVP development. All code changes MUST comply with these principles. 

Amendment Process:
1. Propose changes with clear rationale
2. Review impact on existing features
3. Ensure MVP scope is maintained
4. Update documentation
5. Version control changes

Version Control Policy:
- MAJOR: Breaking architecture changes
- MINOR: New feature additions within MVP scope
- PATCH: Bug fixes and non-breaking improvements
