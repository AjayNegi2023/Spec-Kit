# Feature Specification: Baseline API and UI Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-baseline-api`  
**Created**: 2025-10-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Create baseline API + UI specification with authentication, profiles, and job listings.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Authentication Flow (Priority: P1)

Users need to securely access the portal with their credentials.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is a prerequisite for all other features

**Independent Test**: User can successfully log in and log out

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user with valid credentials, **When** they submit the login form, **Then** they should be authenticated and redirected to dashboard
2. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they click logout, **Then** they should be signed out and redirected to login
3. **Given** invalid credentials, **When** submitting login form, **Then** user should see an error message

---

### User Story 2 - Profile Management (Priority: P1)

Users need to view and update their professional profiles.

**Why this priority**: Core feature for alumni networking

**Independent Test**: User can view and edit their profile information

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they view their profile, **Then** they should see all their profile information
2. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they edit their profile, **Then** changes should be saved and displayed
3. **Given** a user viewing a profile, **When** it's not their own profile, **Then** they should only see read-only view

---

### User Story 3 - Alumni Directory (Priority: P2)

Users need to browse and search the alumni network.

**Why this priority**: Essential for networking but depends on profile management

**Independent Test**: Users can view and search through alumni profiles

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they visit the directory, **Then** they should see a list of alumni profiles
2. **Given** a user in the directory, **When** they use search filters, **Then** they should see filtered results
3. **Given** a user viewing the directory, **When** they click on a profile, **Then** they should see detailed profile view

---

### User Story 4 - Job Board (Priority: P3)

Users need to view available job opportunities.

**Why this priority**: Supplementary feature, read-only for MVP

**Independent Test**: Users can view list of job postings

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they visit the jobs page, **Then** they should see a list of job postings
2. **Given** a user viewing jobs list, **When** they click on a job, **Then** they should see detailed job information

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user session expires during form submission?
- How does system handle concurrent profile edits?
- What happens when profile image upload fails?
- How does system handle network disconnection during authentication?
- What happens when search returns no results?
- How does system handle malformed search queries?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST implement email/password authentication
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to log out and clear their session
- **FR-003**: System MUST protect all routes except login from unauthenticated access
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to view their profile information
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to edit their own profile information
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent users from editing other users' profiles
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a searchable directory of alumni profiles
- **FR-008**: System MUST display a list of job postings with details
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate all user input for required fields
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement proper session management [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: session duration/expiry policy]

### Key Entities

- **User**:
  - Identity and authentication information
  - Role-based access control (student/alumni)
  - Core attributes: id, name, email, role, password

- **Profile**:
  - Professional and academic information
  - Linked to user account
  - Core attributes: id, userId, headline, bio, graduationYear, company, location

- **Job**:
  - Employment opportunity information
  - Posted by alumni
  - Core attributes: id, title, company, description, postedByUserId

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can complete login process in under 30 seconds
- **SC-002**: Profile updates are saved and displayed within 2 seconds
- **SC-003**: Directory search results appear within 1 second
- **SC-004**: System handles at least 100 concurrent users
- **SC-005**: 95% of users can successfully update their profile without assistance
- **SC-006**: Zero unauthorized profile modifications
- **SC-007**: All pages load within 3 seconds
