# Specification Quality Checklist: Baseline API and UI Implementation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

One [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker remains regarding session management (FR-010). This needs to be resolved before proceeding to implementation:

**Question 1: Session Management Policy**

**Context**: FR-010: "System MUST implement proper session management [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: session duration/expiry policy]"

**What we need to know**: What should be the session duration and expiry policy?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| A | 24-hour session with no auto-refresh | Simple to implement, good security, but may interrupt long sessions |
| B | 2-hour session with auto-refresh on activity | Better UX, maintains security, slightly more complex |
| C | 7-day session with "remember me" option | Most convenient for users, but increased security risk |
| Custom | Provide your own session policy | Define custom duration and refresh rules |

**Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
